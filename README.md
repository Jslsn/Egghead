# Egghead :robot: :egg: 
Small project, just a static site hosted and distributed using S3 and CloudFront deployed using GitHub Actions and Terraform.

Definitely not worthy of the arc name, will update it to make things cleaner(things like making the pipeline fire off on specific directory updates, making website updates not require a complete re-run, and making instructions in this README are things I'm eyeing but don't have time to write at the moment).

So basically my excuse for this README being useless in helping you try to deploy this for now is because it's not complete, but it works, trust me bro.
